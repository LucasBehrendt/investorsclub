# Investors Club

[Find the live website here!](https://lucasbehrendt.github.io/investorsclub/)

Investors Club is a website for a club where members are interested in finance and investing.
The website aims to get people interested in a vibrant community of investors from different points in life.
The website is fully responsive across all screen sizes and has been designed to be easily and intuitively navigated.

It is often the case that retail investors are alone, and have trouble finding people around them to engage with.
Investors Club can be a great tool for these people to find each other. 

The site includes a page for local events you can attend, as well as a sign-up/contact form to register for upcoming events.

### Design
- #### Colours
  - The main colour scheme of the website is chosen to suit the theme and to work well together, while simultaneously provide an acceptable contrast. The main font colour is a dark slate gray (#333333) with a combination of a white (#FFFFFF) and a whitesmoke (#EEEEEE) background. Where necessary, for example on the hero image, the font colour is changed to whitesmoke (#EEEEEE).
- #### Typography
  - The main fonts used is Montserrat semi-bold for h1 and h2, with Roboto regular for paragraphs and smaller headings. By researching suitable fonts for financial content, this pairing works very well together according to sites like [this](https://typ.io/fonts/roboto/with/montserrat). If for some reason the fonts aren't imported correctly, Sans serif will serve as fallback.
- #### Imagery
  -  The images used throughout the website are chosen to convey a mix of financial competency and a strong sense of community. A looping video of a rotating skyscraper on the contact page provides a visually alluring element. All images were chosen with care to provide not only pleasing content, but to work well with fonts and colours.

## Features
In the following section i will provide an overview of the features on Investors Club. The site consists of three pages, each with its unique purpose. Some features exists on all pages, while others are specific to a single page and its purpose.

### Nav Bar
- Featured at the very top of all three pages is a navigation bar, which holds the logo for the site on the left hand side, as well as navigation links on the right hand side, 'Home', 'Events' and 'Contact'. These links help the user to easily and intuitively navigate the website, and when hovered over they display a line below the link to further assist in navigation. The logo also serves as a link to the home page, as expected by industry standards.
- For full responsiveness the links will drop down underneath the logo on smaller screen sizes for a more clean and breathing look. The font size will also adapt as screen size is reduced to help give a better and more balanced look.
