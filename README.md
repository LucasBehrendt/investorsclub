# Investors Club

Investors Club is a website for a club where members are interested in finance and investing.
The website aims to get people interested in a vibrant community of investors from different points in life.
It is often the case that retail investors are alone, and have trouble finding people around them to engage with.
Investors Club can be a great tool for these people to find each other. 

The site will include local events you can attend, as well as a sign-up/contact form to become member/attend events.
