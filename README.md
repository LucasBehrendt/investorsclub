# Investors Club

[Find the live website here!](https://lucasbehrendt.github.io/investorsclub/)

Investors Club is a website for a club where members are interested in finance and investing.
The website aims to get people interested in a vibrant community of investors from different points in life.
The website is fully responsive across all screen sizes and has been designed to be easily and intuitively navigated.

It is often the case that retail investors are alone, and have trouble finding people around them to engage with.
Investors Club can be a great tool for these people to find each other. 

The site includes a page for local events you can attend, as well as a sign-up/contact form to register for upcoming events.

### Design
- #### Colours
  - The main colour scheme of the website is chosen to suit the theme and to work well together, while simultaneously provide an acceptable contrast. The main font colour is a dark slate gray (#333333) with a combination of a white (#FFFFFF) and a whitesmoke (#EEEEEE) background. Where necessary, for example on the hero image, the font colour is changed to whitesmoke (#EEEEEE).
- #### Typography
  - The main fonts used is Montserrat semi-bold for h1 and h2, with Roboto regular for paragraphs and smaller headings. By researching suitable fonts for financial content, this pairing works very well together according to sites like [this](https://typ.io/fonts/roboto/with/montserrat). If for some reason the fonts aren't imported correctly, Sans serif will serve as fallback.
- #### Imagery
  -  The images used throughout the website are chosen to convey a mix of financial competency and a strong sense of community. A looping video of a rotating skyscraper on the contact page provides a visually alluring element. All images were chosen with care to provide not only pleasing content, but to work well with fonts and colours.

## Features
In the following section i will provide an overview of the features on Investors Club. The site consists of three pages, each with its unique purpose. Some features exists on all pages, while others are specific to a single page and its purpose.

### Nav Bar
- Featured at the very top of all three pages is a navigation bar, which holds the logo for the site on the left hand side, as well as navigation links on the right hand side, 'Home', 'Events' and 'Contact'. These links help the user to easily and intuitively navigate the website, and when hovered over they display a line below the link to further assist in navigation. The logo also serves as a link to the home page, as expected by industry standards. The nav bar overlays a dark image, and the font colour is therefore whitesmoke (#EEEEEE).
- For full responsiveness the links will drop down underneath the logo on smaller screen sizes for a more clean and breathing look. The font size will also adapt as screen size is reduced to help give a better and more balanced look.

### Landing Page
- The landing page consists of a visually striking and inviting image with a strong sense of a finacial theme. It also includes text overlay with an easy-to-remeber slogan that emphasise the purpose of the club, and a 'Join us' button that links to the contact page. The overlay has a grey background cosistent with the sites colour scheme of dark slate gray (#333333). Just as in the nav bar, the font colour is whitesmoke (#EEEEEE) for contrast.
- The landing page also offers content hinting for the About section, to entice the user to scroll down.

### About Section
- The about section serves as an introduction to the club and contains a summary of the why's and how's behind it. The text emphasize that everyone is welcome, regardless of previous experience in the investment-world. The font colour is the standard dark slate grey (#333333) against the white background.
- As screen size is reduced the text fills up more width of the screen, and on mobile devices the text is justified for a better reading experience.

### Why Join Section
- The why join section consists of an image representing teamwork and a sense of community, and a text explaining the benefits of joining the club. The background is whitesmoke (#EEEEEE) to break off the white and add contrast between the sections. There is an added shadow to the image for a more inviting look.
- This section also offers responsiveness in that the text is moved below the image on smaller screen sizes. Both the image and the text is adjusted in size to fill an appropriate width as screen size shifts.

### Footer
- The footer includes a short copyrght text on the left hand side, and links to different social media plattforms on the right. Since Investors club is fictional the links directs the user to the homepage of each plattform respectively. They also open in a new tab, so the user isn't directed away from the site.
- On smaller screen sizes the links fit below the copyright text, and the font size is reduced, for better positioning.

### Events Page
- The events page is a seperate page that is accessed from the nav bar. The nav bar at the top has been restyled with the standard colour of dark slate grey (#333333) to fit the white background. There are buttons below the nav bar for either 'Bar Meets' or 'Dinners' to jump to the corresponding events. Below the buttons are event cards, three for each category, which contain information about the event, such as date/time and location. The cards also contain an inviting image and a shadow has been added for extra depth.
- The cards will change from horizontal to vertical positioning on smaller screen sizes.
